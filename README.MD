A discord bot I made to use in my own discord server. It is mainly used to play sound files and post links. It will work as long as you create a config.json file as outlined  [here](https://anidiotsguide_old.gitbooks.io/discord-js-bot-guide/content/getting-started/config-json-file.html).

Disclaimer: Make sure you turn your sound down, discbord bots seem to be universally very loud.
