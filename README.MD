A discord bot I made to use in my own discord server. It is mainly used to play sound files and post links. It will work as long as you create a config.json file as outlined  [here](https://anidiotsguide_old.gitbooks.io/discord-js-bot-guide/content/getting-started/config-json-file.html).

Disclaimer: Make sure you turn your sound down, discbord bots seem to be universally very loud.

I am currently working on voting functionality. It will require mongodb but once you have a database of characters you can use them in a head to head voting competition. Examples of this could be anything from Marvel super heros, to soft drinks. I'm going to make it time sensitive so that users may do polls back to back to back.
